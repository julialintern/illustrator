Our strategy is based on the chemical transformation of chromo- genie ligands adsorbed on the surface of a quantum dot. This activates an energy transfer pathway from the quantum dot to the adsorbed chromogenic ligands, which causes a change (e.g., increase or decrease) in a characteristic of fluorescent emission (e.g., intensity or lifetime). Thus, modified quantum dots acting through this mechanism can efficiently transduce a chemical event or occurrence into a change in optical signal.

2041,28.515085,40.539135,10,2006,"The 3-pipe system is a new method of building closed hydraulic networks for heat transfer and fluid distribution. Generally, the new system can be applied in HVAC networks and ensures better and more stable network behaviour during flow adjustment. In other words, it ensures hydraulically balanced networks with optimal behaviour. The basic characteristic of the new three-pipe system is that the central distribution pipe is split into two, in which water flows in the same direction as in the central distribution pipe. Subsequently, the two pipes are joined in one, which is the return pipe. Thus, the pipes create a central loop, which includes the terminal units. The one part of the loop is the point where the terminal unit branches start and the other is where they end. Water flow is ensured by means of a local circulator, which compensates for pressure drop in the branch. In case of reverse flow in deactivated terminal units, a non-return valve is recommended for each terminal unit. The structure of the patent is demonstrated in Fig. &lt;8&gt;. The central distribution pipe «A» is split into two pipes, «B» and «C», in which water flow is also split. The two pipes are joined again in pipe «D», creating a closed loop.

Specifically, cells are grown in medium supplemented with a tyrosine derivative possessing a reactive functional group. The cellular enzyme tubulin tyrosine ligase attaches the unnatural amino acid to a single site on tubulin. Addition of fresh medium containing a suitably derivatized fluorophore then yields fluorescent tubulin, which incorporate into cellular microtubules. Importantly, the tubulin labeling approach demonstrated here does not detrimentally affect microtubule network or cell morphology.

The general idea of the invention is a method of emigraphic researches of the biological subject state at which is registered own spontaneous electromagnetic radiation emitted from the body area with the projection of the selected organ or gland. Two components are registered: a thermal (equivalent temperature signals more than 0.10C) and non thermal or information (equivalent temperature signals below 0.10C). The processing is conducted using input channel calibration through the thermal and non thermal components. Within the framework of this the signals are calibrated in accordance with the anticipated values of the emitted electromagnetic field. After that, making a comparison of synthesized calibrated signals with the calibrated signals which have passed the input channel, receiver internal noises parameters are defined, which distort parameters of the electromagnetic structure, emitted from the human body area. After that the internal noises parameters are used for an optimal correlation processing of the input useful signal. Further on, using a wave structures resonant searching analysis methods at limited centered slidings with minimal shift lengthways control process intervals, quasi-harmonic components are reconstructed (modified wavelet analysis) and non periodic wave structures owing to the excessive volume of information and adapted filtration. In addition to that, in order to eliminate unaccounted processed artefacts at the beginning stage, a cubical spline- interpolation is accomplished and/or multiscale filtration with symmetric non- recursive filters utilized. Calculated dynamic parameters of the thermal and non thermal components are compared with basic (reference) parameters, and it is estimated a pathological degree of organ or gland and a nature of this pathology. After the diagnostics of state of selected organ of gland it is conducted a combined analysis to define a cause-and-reason correlations initiation and a pathological process expansion. The method permits impartially and without any effect to an organism to diagnostics of organ of gland state non-invasively, and reveal the degree and the nature of pathology as well as to estimate cause-and-reason correlations of this pathology.

As phase-separation occurs within this rotating mold, the increase in density of one phase results in sediment at the periphery under centrifugal forces. After or during sedimentation, gelation of the phase-separated particles fixes the tube morphology and the solvent remains in the center of the mold. The solvent is removed from the mold resulting in a tube. By controlling the rotational speed and the formulation chemistry, the tube dimensions and wall morphology can be manipulated.

The maximally allowed deviation from the beginning of a bus cycle is 1 µs, thereby resulting in no queues during communication. The preplanning in the IRT component and the monitoring process carried out by the IRT hardware excludes the possibility of the NRT protocol interfering with the IRT communication component. The PROFINET standard requires that all participants do not transmit more than 3 Kbyte/ms. Such a requirement does not exist in IEEE 802.3, however. More often, there are multiple extensions which oppose said requirement, thereby leading to RT frames now being discarded due to overflowing queues in the network elements because the network component is blocked by NRT communication jumbo frames that are being transmitted at the moment for example. Thus, the RT communication can no longer be maintained such that as a result, the subordinate automation task can no longer be carried out in an error-free manner. In order to diagnose the problem, the network is flooded with packets of the lowest priority so that the network is being utilized at virtually 100% capacity.

This frequency weighting is selected such that the processed set of signals provides a listener with a perceived timbre being substantially the same as a perceived timbre provided by the input set of audio signals. The frequency weighting is preferably based on a magnitude of an ipsi-lateral or a contra-lateral transfer function, or based on a square root of sum of squares of magnitudes of ipsi-lateral and contral-lateral transfer functions. The audio processor is advantageous since it provides a high sound quality without severe tonal coloration and with a stable spatial widening effect tolerant to listener head movements in spite of very narrow-spaced loudspeakers, such as with a listening angle of 4° or less, e.g. in a mobile phone or other handheld devices.
